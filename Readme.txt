The goal of the "game" is simple. who is able to land the first 10 Hits on his opponent, wins.
The opponent only "sees" you when you are infront of him (inside his Field-Of-View, which 
is basically 180 degrees)

You can change the Resolution by changing the SWidth and SHeight Constants

System Requirements:
I tested it on 2 Computers:

Pentium 4-M 1,6 Ghz (Laptop)
256 MB DDR Ram
GeForce 440 (Mobile) - Similar to Geforce 4 MX
--------------------
Runs smoothly in 320x240. 640x480 was bad. Anything above was almost unplayable

Pentium 4 2,5 Ghz (Laptop)
512 MB DDR Ram
Radeon 9600 (Mobile) - Similar to Radeon 9600 Pro
--------------------
No Problems at any Resolution


Since the Current Version has gone under very little Optimization, you can expect it is very slow.

To gain some speed, you could turn of the Mag/Min Texture Filters and turn of Alpha Blending.
